1. Introduction  
Metaheuristic optimization has become one of the essential techniques in solving subsequent computational problems and 
improving cybersecurity. This problem i s especially noticeable as the digital world expands; new threats require the 
evolution of security measures: more effective, versatile, and, at the same time, less resource consuming . Some common 
approaches to managing cybersecurity threats can be slow an d ineffective because the threats are constantly changing. 
Therefore, metaheuristic algorithms capable of searching large solution spaces and avoiding being trapped within local 
optima are enticing solutions. Researchers have shown that they have a lot of promise in enhancing the capabilities of 
cybersecurity systems, particularly in terms of the detection of threats, response mechanisms, and prognostic properties 
[1]. 
Therefore, metaheuristic optimization algorithms can be divided into population -based and  single -solution -based, each 
type addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the other regarding specific problem types. These algorithms are designed 
to intelligently explore the search space and balance between exploration (searching new areas) and explo itation (refining 
current solutions). For instance, the Dipper Throated Algorithm (DTO), a recently developed metaheuristic, has shown 
excellent performance in feature selection and classification tasks, particularly in the medical field, such as 
Electroca rdiogram (ECG) classification, where accurate detection is critical for patient outcomes . Similarly, the 
integration of metaheuristic models that hybridize different combinations has also been proven useful in difficult 
classification problems such as bre ast cancer diagnosis, showing that they can accurately classify complex, non -linear, 
high-dimensional datasets [2].

Received: February  05, 2025 Revised: March 03, 2025 Accepted: May 0 9, 2025  I like this aspect of metaheuristics because of the flexibility these algorithms possess, with an example being used in 
antennae design. For  instance, recent innovations in artificial intelligence have been employed to enhance the design of 
T-shaped monopole antennas to achieve higher performance in contemporary communication systems [3]. In addition, 
metaheuristics were used to predict and mo del metamaterial antenna bandwidth, giving better models for such 
applications as wireless communication and radar Metaheuristic  solutions have the scope of solving a vast number of 
engineering problems, as presented in the following applications.  
Metaheu ristic algorithms are widely discussed in cybersecurity; they are mainly used to improve the efficiency of machine 
learning in the systems of threat detection and response. Real -life situations such as risk detection in the supply chain 
using dynamic votin g classifiers show that the algorithms are useful in high -risk category environments . In a similar 
context, the application of metaheuristics in agricultural image analysis has enhanced the efficiency of weed detection in 
those images captured by drones an d, at the same time, has enhanced the rate of detection in large datasets also [ 5]. 
Making precise predictions is also vital in other fields, such as energy, where hybrid Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) 
models optimized by metaheuristics have been used to fo recast direct normal irradiation for solar power projects in hyper -
arid regions such predictive ability is very important for energy resource management and demonstrates the versatility of 
these techniques.  
Moreover, metaheuristic algorithms like the Chao tic Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm have proven effective 
in solving unconstrained function optimization problems, further solidifying their relevance in cybersecurity and broader 
optimization challenges [8]. Recently, new methods such as the Wat erwheel Plant Algorithm (WWPA)  and the Al -Biruni 
Earth Radius (BER) algorithm [10] have been introduced, expanding the arsenal of optimization techniques available for 
solving complex problems. These algorithms have been tested within practical contexts, and examples include disease 
classification where Monkeypox disease has been classified using deep convolutional neural networks, showing promise 
of the algorithms in pandemic responses [ 6]. 
In addition to the medical and engineering fields, metaheuristics  assist with environmental issues. For instance, in 
agricultural research, metaheuristic -operated models have been employed to estimate the daily evapotranspiration rates 
under semi -arid weather circumstances. These are useful for efficient water supply ma nagement in regions with high 
drought rates hence , metaheuristic approaches have helped to enhance the design and optimization of metamaterial 
antennas, which is one of the essential components of modern wireless communication [13]. Such approaches have a lso 
been used in smart city governance since traffic congestion can be avoided using soft GRU -based recurrent neural 
networks for efficient traffic flow patterns, providing better and real -time planning solutions for smart cities [ 7]. 
Metaheuristics have a lso been applied in environmental control because models developed with metaheuristics have been 
used to predict water quality. For instance, machine -learning  models alongside the grid search method and metaheuristic 
optimization have been used to improve water quality prediction. At the same time, the algorithms explicitly show their 
capability to handle large and complex environmental data From  the article, experience has also shown that metaheuristic 
techniques have been effectively applied to multi -objective optimization problems of even greater difficulty in industrial 
engineering The  recent development of the Puma Optimizer  
In the field of network security, metaheuristic -based optimization has been essential, for example, in feature selection for 
intrusion detection systems. These systems have been designed to monitor and prevent possibly fraudulent activities and 
have been enhanced significantly by hybrid metaheuristic algorithms to improve the detection of possible threats At  the 
same time, change s based on optimized solutions of the proposed Dipper Throated Algorithm have been proposed to 
improve metamaterial antenna design  which proves the constant development of such methods to address practical tasks 
in engineering. In the same way, metaheuris tic algorithms are applied to deep learning models for the prediction of 
customer churn in the telecommunication industry, and they significantly enhance these predictions, where customer 
loyalty seems to be a critical factor [ 8]. 
Wireless sensor networks are another area where these algorithms have made a huge difference, specifically in using 
metaheuristic algorithms. For instance, Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) combined with Particle Swarm Optimization 
(PSO) has been used to enhance the performance of K -Nearest Neighbors algorithms in such networks, improving both 
efficiency and accuracy Also, metaheuristics utilized for solving the energy efficiency problem in buildings, based on the 
hyperparameter optimization of multilayer perceptron models, show grea t prospects in energy saving and increasing 
resource -saving indicators  
Wireless sensor networks have also experienced an improvement in their efficiency through the use of the Al -Biruni Earth 
Radius Optimization algorithm, which optimizes how such network s oversee resource and data utilization  In education, 
metaheuristics have been used in selecting the best prediction models to estimate students' performance and enhance the 
predictiveness of these models; more light is shed on the aspects that influence students' performances in academic 
pursuits  In addition, metaheuristic methods have also been applied in enhancing the predictive features for molding 
student performance across environments and computational studies that compare different learning algori thms for the 
performance of school data [ 9].

Metaheuristic optimization has also worked for cases protecting environments, such as satellite image classification for 
oil spills using machine learning. This application shows that these techniques could hel p towards environmental 
sustainability because event detection of pollution can be achieved more efficiently and effectively . Finally , in 
infrastructural maintenance, metaheuristics have been used in pothole detection in asphalt roads using deep learning 
models, which enhanced road safety and maintenance by providing an accurate real -time detection system [ 10]. 
Metaheuristic optimization methodologies are gaining more significant importance in numerous fields and application 
areas, including computer securit y, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure systems. Due to their ability to fine -tune 
sophisticated systems and learn from environmental changes, these algorithms are becoming critical tools for approaching 
some of the current global issues. The futur e contribution of metaheuristic algorithms to technology and innovation is 
expected to be higher and continue with steady improvements.  
2. Literature Review  
The nature and frequency of cyber threats have evolved with higher levels of sophistication and are constantly growing, 
especially ransomware and malware, making traditional solutions and approaches to security insufficient. This literature 
review explores recent advances in cybersecurity technologies, particularly those leveraging artificial intelligenc e (AI), 
machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). Various studies focus on enhancing ransomware detection, improving 
intrusion detection systems (IDS), securing Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and strengthening cryptographic systems. 
Such advanced techniques prove how AI can work in terms of threat identification, enhancing security measures of 
systems and eradicating new -age cyber threats. Combining these insights, this review underscores the need for the present 
and future constant creation of nov el cybersecurity approaches.  
The diversified types and strains of ransomware threats have posed new challenges to earlier microbiological safety 
solutions that required more of a biological approach.  Discusses  a multi -modal AI -based solution to improve ra nsomware 
attacks' detection, analysis, and prevention. By integrating machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural 
language processing (NLP), the approach provides a comprehensive defense against sophisticated ransomware tactics. 
Supervised and u nsupervised ML algorithms identify ransomware signatures and anomalous behaviors, with 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) detecting patterns in file structures and network traffic. In contrast, long short -
term memory (LSTM) networks analyze system activi ties to identify potential attacks over time. NLP extracts indicators 
of compromise (IOCs) from unstructured data, such as phishing emails and dark web forums. Among the other features, 
sentiment analysis and topic modeling help improve prediction accuracy . Adversarial training as well as defensive 
distillation solve adversarial robustness . Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 -score, and ROC -AUC metrics, the proposed 
approach reveals the possibility of minimizing the consequences of ransomware attac ks and the time required to solve 
them.  
Global cyber threats have been reported to be rising in both frequency and severity and, therefore, require more strategic 
cybersecurity solutions. According to the work done in [ 11], intelligence for cybersecurity r isk management is conducted 
using frameworks that form a basis for management solutions that contradict risk by evaluating existing cybersecurity 
data. Other structures, including the MITRE ATT&CK, provide up -to-date countermeasures in response to the atta cker's 
capacity; however, they do not utilize hackers in constructing cyber threat intelligence. To partially fill this gap, the 
researchers created ATT&CK -Link, a new information technology artifact enriched with a transformer and multi -teacher 
knowledge distillation architecture. This framework extends hacker threats to the MITRE, a regularly applied framework. 
The paper illustrates how these hospital systems can use ATT&CK -Link to prevent hacker threats to their cyber 
infrastructure. This framework makes  it possible for effective cybersecurity professionals to develop strategic, operational 
and tactical cyber threat intelligence. Similarly, ATT&CK -Link helps reinforce the knowledge base of information 
systems by providing structures with mechanisms for fo cused cybersecurity measurement, analysis,  and broader text 
analysis investigation as part of real parallel multi -vector distillation and classification.  
As the threat actors' process evolves, so does the threat environment, making it necessary to shift the cybersecurity 
strategies. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has become a robust model based on the principle of "Never Trust, Always 
Verify," demanding intelligent access control and threat mitigation. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine 
Learning (ML), offers significant potential to augment ZTA by automating threat detection and enabling real -time 
responses. This work examines the solution of AI -embedded threat detection under ZTA architectures, where ML 
algorithms are employed to recognize anomalies and provide responsive countermeasures. It highlights the limitations of 
traditional security models in combating sophisticated attacks like social engineering and advanced persistent threats 
(APTs). ML is best used for segmenting and analyzing b ig data security sets to identify anomalous or deviant user 
behavior. In addition , AI responds to incidents automatically and moves for threatening hunting in ZTA. The study also 
acknowledges the challenges of integrating AI, emphasizing the need for high -quality  training data and explainable AI 
(XAI) to ensure transparency  [12].

Received: February  05, 2025 Revised: March 03, 2025 Accepted: May 0 9, 2025  The Internet of Things (IoT) interconnects physical and virtual objects embedded with sensors, software, and technologies 
that exchange data over the Internet.  Despite IoT's benefits by establishing connections and personalizing billions of 
devices and people, it presents severe threats to security. Due to the exponential growth in the use of IoT devices, they 
are a favorite of hackers who aim at spying on users and intruding on their pri vacy. Because of such features and 
constraints of IoT, one can see some of the threats unique to this domain,, including confidentiality, authentication, access  
control and privacy. This paper measures and discusses the threats in IoT and categorizes them based on the layers of the 
IoT model. They include countermeasures, mitigation measures, and other related topics: An examination of selected 
common application layer protocols commonly applied on IoT networks, their security threats/vulnerabilities,, and some 
of their main constraints [13]. 
The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has raised significant security concerns, with cyber -attacks 
such as denial -of-service attacks, malware infections, and phishing posing serious risks.  Using security mechanisms 
based on machine learning is suggested for overcoming the mentioned challenges, underlining the need for the models' 
high stability and several defensive actions. The study employs the Ridge Classifier as a strong weapon for finding 
arrangers in IoT systems. It provides the ability to detect and prevent cyber -attacks in real -time with the help of a 
comprehensible array of secure network data. Experimental findings reveal that the system's effectiveness for threat 
identification and preve ntion is very high, with a rate of accuracy recorded at 97 percent. This effectiveness strengthens 
the governmental and business networks and makes important data safe from malicious threats. The study emphasizes 
that it is impossible to ensure the so -called 'secure -by-design' IoT networks without the use of Machine Learning -based 
security instruments and that the proposed technique of the 'Ridge Classifier' model comprehensively insulates IoT 
networks against cyber threats in terms of data and network inte grity, confidentiality, and availability [14]. 
Network cyber threats have targeted many intrinsic system vulnerabilities; thus, network intrusion detection is a critical 
component of the cybersecurity field.  Intrusion  detection systems (IDSs) using machine  learning (ML) have been 
developed to make decisions with minimal human intervention. While ML -based IDS advancements have surpassed 
traditional methods, they still face challenges in achieving high detection rates (DR) and low false alarm rates (FAR) [15]. 
This paper proposes a meta -heuristic optimization algorithm -based hierarchical IDS to enhance the identification of 
different attacks and safe computing spaces. The approach consists of three stages: data pre -processing, feature extraction, 
and data divis ion; choosing the best hyperparameters of the ELM using two new meta -heuristic algorithms; and sorting 
of binary models using a hierarchical anomaly detection system. The proposed IDS effectively and efficiently does multi -
classification, and the average a ccuracy, DR, and FAR were estimated to be 98.93%, 99.63% and 99.19%, with a FAR 
of 0.01 on the UNSW -NB15 and CICIDS2017 dataset  [16]. 
The increasing use of the Internet, with its inherent vulnerabilities, has necessitated the adoption of Intrusion Detectio n 
Systems (IDS) to ensure network security. Presents  IDSs as important systems that recognize intrusions, invasions, and 
network failures [ 17]. The intrusion detection problem is posed as classification, and selecting the features is important 
for classific ation techniques [ 18]. Several conventional approaches exist, including Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, Data 
Mining, and Metaheuristic techniques. A novel approach is introduced using the Horse Herd Optimization Algorithm 
(HOA) for feature selection in networ k intrusion detection. The Adjustment Hopping Oscillator is currently incorporated 
into a discrete quantum, inspired, and multi -objective optimizer. MQBHOA, this algorithm incorporates quantum -
computing  components to optimize the exploration -exploitation t rade-off. The K -Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier is 
used, and the method is tested on NSL -KDD and CSE -CIC-IDS2018 datasets [19]. The results compare favorably to 
previously evaluated algorithms and show a 6% increase in feature selection and classificatio n accuracy – 99.8% for 
intrusion detection.  
Internet services and applications have become more popular, potentially escalating cyber crusades, unauthorized 
application utilization, and threatening service accessibility and consumer privacy.  A network Int rusion Detection System 
(IDS) is designed to detect abnormal traffic behaviors that firewalls might miss. Some measures include feature selection,, 
which is a process of narrowing narrowing  down data dimensions to eliminate irrelevant data that adds value t o IDS. This 
paper presents a modified Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm to improve IDS efficacy in detecting normal and 
anomalous network traffic. The enhancements include the intelligent filter and wrapper integrated smart initialization 
phase to pro mote informative features initially. Additionally, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used for high -
speed classification, with GWO employed to optimize ELM's parameters. In general attacks detection tested on the 
UNSWNB -15 dataset, the proposed model pr oduced accuracy, F1 -score and G -mean of 81%,78% and 84%, respectively, 
and crossover and false positives of less than 30%.  
Rapid developments in Internet of Things (IoT) systems have led to widespread integration into daily life, particularly in 
areas like  healthcare, where real -time monitoring can significantly affect  outcomes. According to [ 20], concerning the 
issues that hinder IoT interoperability on a larger scale, one of the challenges is sustainability, especially in healthcare 
services, which has to  provide accurate organization of services without negatively influencing the environment. Security 
remains fundamental to the survival of IoT systems, and early detection and tackling challenges remain compulsory  [21]. 
The present research explores the Io T security concern using machine learning optimized with a modified Firefly

powerful in solving NP -hard problems with acceptable speed and p recision to support sustainable systems. Machine 
learning models used in experiments included a range of models trained on IoT structure's synthetic datasets, enhanced 
by improved Firefly metaheuristics. Shapley's Additive explanations (SHAP) analysis was used to identify key factors 
contributing to security issues. Testing and comparison experiments reveal meaningful enhancements to solve the issues 
mentioned above [ 22]. 
In recent years, rapid advancements in smart devices have led to an exponential increas e in the data generated, known as 
Big Data (BD), which traditional analytics techniques struggle to handle.  The increase in these data also leads to new 
opportunities for attack methods such as SQL injection attacks, Operating Systems fingerprinting attac ks, and malicious 
code execution during data analysis [ 23]. This paper explores Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models 
capable of identifying and mitigating known and unknown attacks. These techniques use traffic data sets for training and 
testing to make wise decisions for an attack in a large network environment. The paper also proposes a DL and ML -based 
Secure Data Analytics (SDA) architecture to classify input data as normal or attack -related. Threat modeling is used to 
identify challenges t o expand a detailed taxonomy of the SDA and encompasses surface area, efficiency, latency, 
accuracy, and reliability. Lastly, comparing existing SDA proposals enables users to select the most appropriate solution 
according to its benefits [ 24]. 
Cybersecurit y has gained significant attention due to the widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid 
growth of computer networks, and the increasing number of related applications. As highlighted in [ 25], detecting cyber -
attacks or anomalies in net works and developing effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) is becoming increasingly 
crucial. This paper introduces "IntruDTree," a machine learning -based security model designed to build an intelligent 
IDS. The model categorizes the security features  based on the priority level and builds a generalized detection tree model 
from the most relevant features. This approach facilitates the increase of pass rates of other unseen cases and reduces 
computational costs regarding feature dimensions. The impact of the IntruDTree model was also investigated through 
experiments on cybersecurity datasets, where several performance measures such as precision, recall, F1 -score, accuracy, 
and ROC values were used in the evaluations. Further, IntruDTree was evaluated ag ainst conventional machine learning 
techniques such as naive Bayesian, logistic regression, support vector machine, and k -neighbor and exhibited the best 
result.  
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is crucial for identifying complex network attacks.  Anomaly -based  IDS (AIDS) 
systems have increasingly utilized machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms  [26]. Nevertheless, the 
literature presents some shortcomings, including random choice of sequences, utilization of outdated data sets and 
superf icial method validation. This paper also compares and contrasts various algorithms, parameters, and testing criteria 
in currently available AIDS studies using different datasets and attack types. Ten well -known supervised and 
unsupervised ML algorithms are  used to estimate successful AIDS solutions. These include supervised methods like 
artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees (DT), k -nearest neighbor (k -NN), and unsupervised methods like k -means 
and self -organizing maps (SOM). The analysis also dis cusses algorithm tuning and training parameters about classifier 
assessment. [27] In contrast to previous works, this work assesses 31 ML -AIDS models using true positive/negative rates, 
accuracy, precision, recall, the F1 -score, and training/testing time. D espite being a highly imbalanced multiclass 
CICIDS2017 dataset, k -NN-AIDS, DT -AIDS, and NB -AIDS models were more effective in detecting web attacks than 
others.  
The rise in computer networks and internet attacks has become a significant concern for service  providers, leading to the 
increased need for effective intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to mitigate network intrusions.  while IDSs have been 
crucial in identifying network attacks, many existing models struggle with high false alarm rates and difficult y in detecting 
certain attack types, particularly User -to-Root (U2R) and Remote -to-Local (R2L) attacks. These attacks sometimes pose 
lower detection algorithm accuracy in the current IDS model. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a 
bidirection al Long -Short -Term -Memory (BiDLSTM) based IDS designed to improve detection accuracy and reduce false 
alarms. The proposed model was trained and tested NSL -KDD, a standard IDS development dataset. Experimental results 
confirm the usefulness of the BiDLSTM model, which, besidesbesides having higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 -
score compared with traditional LSTM or some other state -of-art models, has also significantly lowered the number of 
false alarms. Furthermore, using the proposed BiDLSTM model,  it was possible to detect the U2R and R2L attacks with 
improved detection accuracy relative to models based only on LSTM.  
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used across industries for monitoring, data transmission, and gathering 
tasks, especially within the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, due to the small sensor nodes (SN) involved, 
resource management aimed at energy efficiency is a key challenge.  Power consumption for the interpretation, 
transmission and storage of data between th e sensors should be minimal to enhance the operation of the network. In 
addition to energy efficiency, the aspects of network security, namely intrusion detection and prevention, constitute a 
significant issue. This work introduces the Meta -Heuristic -Based  Secure and Energy -Efficient Routing (MHSEER) 
protocol for WSN -IIoT, which optimizes forwarding decisions based on hops, connection integrity, and remaining energy.

Received: February  05, 2025 Revised: March 03, 2025 Accepted: May 0 9, 2025  To enhance security, the protocol incorporates counter -encryption mode (CEM) for data encry ption. The protocol operates 
in two stages: the first is applicable for secure data routing using heuristics, and the second is CEM for security 
enhancement. When compared MHSEER with other protocols such as Sectrust -RPL and HBEER, the performance is 
enhan ced greatly by boosting throughput to 95.81%, reducing packet drop ratio,h, packet delay and energy consumption 
and faulty pathways to 5.12%, 0.10ms, 0.0102mJ and 6.51%, respectively.  
The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) security is crucial, as it connect s various medical devices to enhance patient care 
and real -time monitoring.  Proposed high -security frameworks that include attribute -based access control, encryption and 
privacy. However, many of these models are either too complex or not flexible enough for real -time processing, for their 
security performance relies heavily on internal parameters that cannot be changed in response to a new threat. These 
drawbacks are the main reason for developing an improved hybrid metaheuristic model for better security  of IoT in 
healthcare. The model first employs blockchain technology but can dynamically change internal hashing and encryption 
as required. By combining Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), the model 
optimizes security and  quality of service in blockchain -based IoMT systems [ 28]. The forward fitness functions are 
secure, and the service quality is good against threats like DDoS, man -in-the-middle, masquerading, and Sybil attacks. 
The other is the dual fitness functions. In t his proposed model, the average results of state -of-the-art models have been 
compared, and the results obtained from the proposed model are increases in network consistency by 8.7%, throughput 
by 6.4% and packet delivery by 8.2%. In contrast, attack detect ion and mitigation are 9.4% higher. The potential of the 
model to be used in real -time healthcare use cases can be inferred from these results.  
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical objects communicating with other devices through th e 
Internet.  Which  states that security plays a significant role in IoT -based communication since it is hard to standardize the 
devices in the network. These systems have been described as interconnects; it remains difficult to guarantee security, 
identity , permission, and privacy. This paper proposes a novel Chaotic Bumble Bees Mating Optimization (CBBMO) 
algorithm for secure data transmission integrated with a trust -sensing model (CBBMOR -TSM) to address these issues. 
The use of the concepts of chaos in en hancing the rate of convergence of the CBBMO model increases the rate of 
convergence of the classical Bumble Bees Mating Optimization. The model's primary objective is to design a trust -sensing 
system for capturing malicious nodes and guarantee secure rout ing. The trust values of IoT nodes will be computed using 
direct and indirect trust to identify threats. Security routing is then done using the CBBMO algorithm to determine the 
best path for transmitting data. The model's performance was tested extensivel y, showing superior results with a higher 
average Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.931 and a lower average Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) of 0.069, outperforming 
other methods such as TRM_IOT, OSEAP_IOT, and MCTAR -IOT, which had higher PLRs of 0.219, 0.161, and 0 .110, 
respectively.  
Even in today's advanced digital security systems using passwords or PIN codes developed, cryptographic keys are 
usually the output of stochastic or probabilistic random processes or are derived using complex mathematical 
transformation s. As for these methods, despite their considerable strength, their storage and distribution need proper and 
costly means. According to   to apply biometric data for generating cryptographic keys to avoid difficulties in storing and 
distributing them. The research focuses on biometric key generation technologies utilizing deep learning models, 
specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to extract biometric features from facial images. A set of features is 
then extracted from the audio signals subjec ted to code -based cryptographic extractors. The performance of different deep 
learning models and the cryptographic extractor was assessed regarding detection accuracy and false positive rate, and 
the optimized parameters yielded less than 10% error rate. The low error rate of the generated key makes the generated 
keys suitable for biometric authentication. Furthermore, the use of code -based cryptographic extractors is secure from 
quantum attacks and makes the biometric key generation technique more viable in today's IT security systems. The present 
study contributes to designing safe, effective, and robust authentication techniques due to biometrics and deep learning  
[29]. 
This study focuses on side -channel attacks targeting cryptographic devices protected by the Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES).  The research introduces the assessment of guessing entropy (GE) and the associated uncertainty in 
machine -learning -based attacks that rely on power measurements. For the first time, GE was evaluated for the entir e key, 
and uncertainty was applied to the side -channel attack, making the device more decisive in terms of vulnerability. The 
attack employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify power traces leaked from physically accessible devices, with a 
public dat abase used to ensure reproducibility. Critical values for resilient state estimation can be used to quantify 
uncertainty in key byte retrieval and then projected to the total key using Monte Carlo analysis. The findings reveal that 
the former holds a proba bility of 10% based on roughly 4000 attack traces, whereas the latter holds for fewer than ten 
attempts. This means that the side -channel attack could reveal a complete cryptographic key near one in every ten tries 
across one hundred similar gadgets, underscoring a huge safety vulnerability, especially in IoT settings. The study reflects 
that the field requires better vulnerability testing and enhanced countermeasures.  
With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), vast amounts of data that re quire processing are generated. Although cloud 
computing usually solves such tasks, they have disadvantages, such as latency and security fields.  Fog computing has

However, it is challenging to decide which node to choose because of cloud and fog node heterogeneity; fog nodes are 
resource -constrained and have limited processing capability. As a result, to fully exploit the fog nodes, this paper de velops 
a secure two -step service placement framework. The first step involves classifying services to determine whether they 
should be processed on the cloud or fog tier, using an improved adaptive neuro -fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for 
prediction. The s econd step applies a novel metaheuristic -based hybrid algorithm combining a chaotic -based grasshopper 
optimization algorithm (CGOA) with a genetic algorithm (GA) to schedule services at the fog tier. The proposed CGOA 
adapts the shortcomings of the basic G OA, such as slow convergence and being a victim of local minima, by using ideas 
from chaos theory and Opposition -based learning. The cumulative makespan, total functions executed and energy used 
by the proposed model, upon testing with Google trace dataset , were found to yield better percentage improvements by 
an average of 9.2% on makespan, 4.25 % on the total functions executed and 2.75 % on the energy dissipation as compared 
to the existing literature.  
Cloud computing is a rapidly emerging distributed computing model that offers utility computing services over the 
Internet context suitable for large -scale, workflow -based, large -application solutions for business and science. More 
specifically,  the issue of scheduling the multiple workflows that compris e a processing pipeline is critical since it 
determines execution time and associated costs. This paper presents an enhanced workflow scheduling approach by 
hybridizing the recent Ant -Lion Optimization (ALO) algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) , specifically 
designed for cloud environments. A security mechanism using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) is also incorporated 
to secure cloud data during the scheduling process. The proposed hybrid optimization is expected to enhance the 
scheduling ou tcome and security compared to other frameworks. The proposed method is validated with the help of the 
CloudSim tool, which analyzes cost, load balancing, and makespan. The results show that the proposed method 
outperforms existing approaches such as round robin  (RR), ALO, PSO, and GA -PSO, reducing costs by up to 30% 
compared to RR, with similar load balancing and makespan improvements. The proposed system also shows energy 
efficiency and system reliability advantages.  
The problem that internet users face t oday is the emergence of various types of viral software, particularly polymorphic 
viruses that are more flexible than traditional viruses. This is because polymorphic malware modifies some features aimed 
at escaping detection by traditional models of pick ing out incidents based on signatures, To address this, the study 
examines the following machine learning algorithms to distinguish the most accurate algorithm detecting malware. A 
high detection ratio was used to decide which algorithm was the most effect ive, and the confusion matrix was used to 
determine the number of false positives and false negatives to measure the system's efficacy. The work showed that 
spectrum symmetry could  be used to identify malicious traffic and enhance the cyber protection of com puter networks 
based on the comparison of various models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, J48, and RF. The findings revealed that Decision 
Trees (DT) achieved the highest detection accuracy (99%), followed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at 98.76% 
and Supp ort Vector Machines (SVM) at 96.41%. Additionally, DT, CNN, and SVM achieved low false positive rates 
(FPR) of 2.01%, 3.97%, and 4.63%, respectively, underscoring the importance of advanced detection methods as malware 
becomes increasingly sophisticated.  
Malware is constantly changing,; therefore improvised ways of detecting it are required. Dynamic malware detection is 
proposed to combat the ever -emerging and even more complex internet. As for the problem discussed in the paper, 
traditional manual heurist ic approaches to addressing the enormous volume of malicious programs are no longer 
sufficient. Based on this, the study demonstrates an automatic behavior -based malware detection and evaluation of threats 
in an emulation environment using machine -learning  algorithms. Such behaviors are logged down, encoded, and 
quantized into vectors in sparse model forms for further use. Classifiers such as k -Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision 
Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Ext ra Trees, and Gaussian Naive Bayes 
(NB) were applied to synthesize the results. RF, SGD, Extra Trees, and Gaussian NB classifiers achieved 100% accuracy, 
with perfect precision (1.00), recall (1.00), and F1 -scores (1.00) in the testing phase. The implicati ons explain automatic 
behavior -based malware analysis when augmented with machine learning for the rapid identification of emerging 
malware threats to be efficient.  
The analyzed publications show the centrality of AI, ML, and DL in present -day cyber securi ty strategies in response to 
problems such as ransomware or attacks on IoT devices. These technologies enhance stronger, flexible and timely 
countermeasures to new risks. In addition, they offer solutions that allow various types of protection, such as hea lthcare, 
cloud, and industrial networks for businesses at scale. Since the threat moves dynamically, there is a need for the constant 
development of these fields to help protect structures that are connected to digital technology. More specifically, the ne xt 
studies need to devote their efforts to enhancing these systems' scalability, soundness, and interpretability to build a step  
ahead of cyber adversaries [ 30]. 
3. Conclusion  
This literature review focuses on the current trends in enhancing cyber security tec hnologies through AI, ML, and DL for 
current cyber threats. From ransomware detection and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to IoT and cloud computing

integration proves that the application of machine learning models alongside traditional ones increases the overall 
detection rate, minimizes false positives, and improves system overall system durability. Furthermore, deploying 
metaheuris tic algorithms, adversarial training, and explainable AI (XAI) shows promise in creating more adaptive and 
robust security solutions. However, due to the ever -changing nature of cyber threats, further research could help maintain 
their relevance, efficienc y and ability to neutralize new threats on a large scale. It is therefore advisable that future 
endeavors be directed towards enhancing visibility, increasing potential response rates in rinl -time, and continuing to 
explore other arenas where similar inven tions may be applied in otoahead of the causes of cyber security threats.
